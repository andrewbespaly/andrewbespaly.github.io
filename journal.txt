Portfolio Project Journal

Created a new repo for my portfolio website and renamed the assignment I started on from homework1. When I tried to visit the website it only showed the readme file. I fixed this by naming the files to index.html and index.css.

I'm going to make an outline of the things I want to have on the website so I can complete them as I go.

Outline:
	I want to implement a bar on top that follows the page down with links that redirect to the different sections on the same page.
	
	About me section at the top of the webpage.

	Past Projects section, with pictures, descriptions, and github repo links
	
	Contact me section, I want it to actually work and send me an email to my professional email address, but I'm not sure if time will permit.
